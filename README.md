# Advent of Code 2020 Repo

**I make stuff here. Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's readable, sometimes it's functional. There are no guarantees.**

My goal is to create performant solutions that will work
 * for any valid input file, and 
 * without hardcoded values

I will also try to post some performance results for each of the day's solutions
